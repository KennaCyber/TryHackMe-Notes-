# What is SIEM

- Security Information and Event Management system

    1. Collects data from various endpoints(any device that connects to a computer network)/network devices across the network
    
    2. stores them at a centralized place(saves that info in one main system, usually a SIEM)

    3. performs correlation on them (finds patterns to find suspicious activity)

**Network Visibility through SIEM üåê**

Image shows a network with Linux/Windows based endpoints, one data server, and one website. They all communicate & reach the internet through a router

- Each network component(parts that makes up a computer network) can have one or more log sources generating different logs(logs are like journal entries that record whats happening)
 
    - It's like your house having different smart devices, each logging different types of activities
 
1. Host-Centric Log Sources (host = any device connected to a network that can send or receive data)

Log sources that capture events that occured within or related to the host.

Examples of host-centric log souces:
   
  - Windows Event logs, Sysmon, Osquery

Example of host-centric logs:

  - User accessing file & attempting to authenticate (someone trying to get in and what they're trying to access)

  - a process Execution Activity (program or script starts running)

  - A process adding, editing, deleting a registry key or value (changes system settings)
    
  - Powershell execution 

2. Network-Centric Log sources

These logs are generated when the hosts communicate with each other or access the internet to visit a website

Examples of network-based protocols (set of rules devices follow to commuicate over a network):

  - SSH connection

  - File accessed via FTP

  - Web traffic

  - User accessing company's resources through VPN

  - Network file sharing activity

**Importance of SIEM**

- Investigating hundreds of events that generate per second on each device can be tedious

- SIEM takes log from various sources and can correlate between events, search through them, investigate and respond

Key features provided by SIEM are:
 
  - Real-time log ingestion (See everything as it happens)
 
  - Alerting against abnormal activities
 
  - 24/7 Monitoring and visibility
 
  - Protection against latest threats through early detection
 
  - Data insights and visualization (turns raw data into graphs, dashboards, etc)
 
  - Ability to investigate past incidents

**Log Sources and Log Ingestion üìäüîÅ**

Every device in the network generates logs when there is activity on it

  - Example: User visits a website, connects to SSH, logging into workstation

Windows Machine

- Windows records every event (Viewed in Event Viewer utility)

- Assigns unique ID to each type of log activity

- Type "Event Viewer" in the search bar

- These logs are forwarded to the SIEM solution (for monitoring and better visibility)

Linux Workstation

- Linux OX stores all the related logs (events, errors, warnings, etc)

- Common locations where linux stores logs:
<pre>
/var/log/httpd  - Contains HTTP Request / Response and error logs
/var/log/cron  - Events related on cron jobs (command that system runs on its own) are stored in this location
/var/log/auth.log and var/log/secure  - Stores authentication related logs
/var/log/karn  - This file stores kernel related events (generated by linux kernel, the core part of the OS, the brain)
</pre>

**Web Server**

- Important to look at requests/responses in and out of the webserver (for potential web attack attempt)

- In Linux, common locations to write all apache(apache = web server software, listens for requests like "show me this webpage" and sends back the content so browser can display it) related logs are
<pre>
/var/log/apache or /var/log/httpd
</pre>

**Log Ingestion**

Logs provide a wealth of info that can help identify security issues. Each SIEM solution has its own way of ingesting the logs:

1) Agent / Forwarder

    - Small tool installed on each device(forwarder by Splunk), collects important logs and sends them to the SIEM system.
  
2) Syslog:

    - Commonly used protocol used to send real-time data from systems like web servers or databases to a centralized destination 

3) Manual Upload:

    - You can manually upload log files into the SIEM (Like Splunk or ELK) for analysis. The SIEM organizes the data so it's easy to search and understand

4) Port-Forwarding:

    - The SIEM listens on a specific network port, and devices send their logs directly to that port (so SIEM collects them)
